# Litmus Chaos Elmo Demo
Few weeks ago I was priviledged to speak as panel member about **Chaos Engineering** at [Contributing Today](https://www.contributing.today/) Meetup. Next to me there where some other great panel members like Jason Yee from Gremlin and maintainers of Chaos Monkey @Netflix. If you are not yet familiar yet, just learn about [Principles of Chaos](https://principlesofchaos.org/) and view the recording on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/m-WZEvrPvAY).

During that session I gave a mini demo how to start experimenting with Chaos Engineering on Kubernetes. For this I chose `Litmus Chaos` which is one of the promising `CNCF` sandbox projects for `Chaos Engineering` mentioned at the CNCF Interactive Landscape.

## Deploying Litmus
Deploying Litmus is easy. For sandbox experiments you just can apply the manifest. Also the documentation is well-updated, so you shouldn't get into problems with any of the cloud provider offerings like `AKS`, `EKS` or `GKE`. For example I have created this demo on `GKE` without any problems. See below the architecture setup.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avwsolutions/litmus-chaos-elmo-demo/master/architecture-setup.png" alt="architecture setup">

Below the initial steps to take.  Please note that these are here to help you getting started. More current information see [Getstarted documentation](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/)

First apply the manifest to setup the Litmus Operator.
```
kubectl apply -f https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-operator-v1.13.3.yaml
```

After some seconds you can check if the Pod is entering a `RUNNING` state and all `CRDs` are available.

The following CRDs should be available
- chaosengines *(The engine that combines a Chaos experiment with a plan to execute.)*
- chaosexperiments *(The actual available Chaos experiments to run.)*
- chaosresults *(The stored results of your Chaos experiment.)*

```
kubectl get pods -n litmus
kubectl get crds | grep chaos
```

## Deploy our Elmo App
For this exercise I have created a `simple Elmo App` that is based on `nginx` and some `html` content that needs to be loaded. Nothing special here. For convenience I still have the `talk-chaos` available at [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/avwsolutions/talk-chaos).

Create the elmo namespace and apply the following manifest to start the Elmo App.

```
kubectl create ns elmo
kubectl apply -f elmo-app.yaml -n elmo
```

If everything goes well you wil now have a `elmo-app` service that is exposed through a `LoadBalancer`.  You can check it with the command below and write down the external ip. For troubleshooting use `describe svc` or just use a `NodePort` based service. 

```
kubectl get svc elmo-app -n elmo
```

## Prepare Elmo App for Chaos!!!
Now that we have both `Litmus Chaos` and our targeted and beloved `Elmo App` running we can start implementing some prerequisites. Most prerequisites need to be applied on the elmo namespace.

Most important thing here is to think about the `hypothesis` or `scenario` to run.
Which `experiments` do apply here?
What is Elmo App `steady-state`?

Let's start and select some experiments to help us to reveal system weaknesses. 

1. First we need make the required chaos experiments available within the `elmo namespace`.
2. Secondly a `service account` to ensure the required and fine grained `rbac permissions` are available for the `chaosengine` to execute the experiment.
3. Last thing we must not forget is to `annotate` your target application.

During the demo we will use two generic ways to start with chaos experiments, but I do want to inform you about the great source of experiments that are available for you at [Chaos Hub](https://hub.litmuschaos.io/).  Like for Kafka, CoreDNS or specific for AWS.


Start with making the `generic` experiments available for elmo. For simplicity we apply all of them.
```
kubectl apply -f https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/1.13.3?file=charts/generic/experiments.yaml -n elmo
```

Now we need to setup the `rbac permissions`, which includes ServiceAccount, Role and Rolebinding objects.
```
kubectl apply -f elmo-chaos-rbac.yaml -n elmo
```

Last step is to annotate our deployed `Elmo App`, so we are sure it's registered as an official target. 
```
kubectl annotate deploy/elmo-app litmuschaos.io/chaos="true" -n elmo --overwrite
```

## Start our Chaos experiments
Now that we have everything in-place we can start defining our hypothesis.

## First experiment

Let's with our hypothesis that during container, worker node failures our `Elmo App` is still available for our end users using the browser.

### Goal
Terminate app pods should not prevent the Elmo App from running and being unavailable for the end user.

### Description
Since we are reyling on Kubernetes to provide Pod Replicas, we expect that the Elmo App should run fine without affecting the user experience even when one of the app pods is terminated.

### Execute experiment

Now let's start defining our `Chaos runner`. Before actually applying this Chaos Engine, please look at the following values.

- Ensure your `appinfo` is set correct for both deployment and pods.
- Ensure that the `chaosServiceAccount` is set as named above.
- By default we cleanup the Job when ready, but you can retain it.
- You can customize your `experiment` in the `experiments` section.

```
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: elmo-chaos
  namespace: elmo
spec:
  appinfo:
    appns: 'elmo'
    applabel: 'app=elmo-app'
    appkind: 'deployment'
  # It can be true/false
  annotationCheck: 'true'
  # It can be active/stop
  engineState: 'active'
  #ex. values: ns1:name=percona,ns2:run=nginx
  auxiliaryAppInfo: ''
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-delete-sa
  # It can be delete/retain
  jobCleanUpPolicy: 'delete'
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # set chaos duration (in sec) as desired
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: '30'

            # set chaos interval (in sec) as desired
            - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
              value: '10'
              
            # pod failures without '--force' & default terminationGracePeriodSeconds
            - name: FORCE
              value: 'false'
```

Now apply this manifest.

```
kubectl apply -f chaos-experiment-job.yaml -n elmo
```

After applying this manifest take a look at the available pods and notice that some new pods are created like the `elmo-chaos-runner` and the experiment pod called `pod-delete` itself. Also notice the terminated elmo pods.

```
kubectl get pods -n elmo -w
```

Now start monitoring our browser session. You can also use a `curl-loop` to run a heartbeat.

```
while true ;do curl http://YourFamousIP; sleep 1 ; done
``` 

### Result

After the experiment we can conclude that the application became unavailable during the experiment. Of course you already seen that we only have set one replica, which is not providing fault-tolerance.

```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 35.23.192.64 port 80: Connection refused
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 35.23.192.64 port 80: Connection refused
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 35.23.192.64 port 80: Connection refused
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 35.23.192.64 port 80: Connection refused
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 35.23.192.64 port 80: Connection refused
```

To view the actual result from Litmus Chaos experiment we can describe the stored result report, which contains the run history and experiment status either `Pass` or `Fail`.

```
kubectl get chaosresult -n elmo
kubectl describe chaosresult elmo-chaos-pod-delete -n elmo
```

Let's start with increasing our replica count. Great we have solved our first weakness.

```
kubectl scale --replicas=3 deploy/elmo-app -n elmo
```

## Bonus experiment

### Goal
Poisoning app pods network traffic and introducing latency should not prevent the Elmo App from running and being unavailable for the end user.

### Description
Since we are reyling on Kubernetes to provide Pod Replicas and browser cache, we expect that the Elmo App should run fine without affecting the user experience even when one of the app pods is having network latency.

### Execute experiment

Now let's start defining our `Chaos runner`. Before actually applying this Chaos Engine, please look at the following values. Take a notice we only have replaced the `experiments` section.

```
...
  experiments:
    - name: pod-network-latency
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            #Network interface inside target container
            - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
              value: 'eth0'     

            - name: NETWORK_LATENCY
              value: '2000'

            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: '60' # in seconds

            # provide the name of container runtime
            # for litmus LIB, it supports docker, containerd, crio
            # for pumba LIB, it supports docker only
            - name: CONTAINER_RUNTIME
              value: 'docker'

            # provide the socket file path
            - name: SOCKET_PATH
              value: '/var/run/docker.sock'
```

Now apply this manifest.

```
kubectl apply -f chaos-experiment-bonus.yaml -n elmo
```

After applying this manifest take a look at the available pods and notice that again some new pods are created like the `elmo-bonus-runner` and the experiment pod called `pod-network-latency` itself. 

```
kubectl get pods -n elmo -w
```

Now start monitoring our browser session.For this you can use `Developer tools` (part of Chrome or Edge) to measure the actual network load time.  You can also use a `curl-loop` to run a heartbeat.

```
while true ;do curl http://YourFamousIP; sleep 1 ; done
``` 

### Result

After this experiment we can conclude that the browser cache is working, but still the first session goes from milliseconds to seconds loading time. To mitigate this is the future we can make use of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to pre-cache our images like Elmo, even closer to the end user. Implementing an CDN is out of scope for this example.  

Again we have found a weakness to solve in our Elmo App Architecture.

To view the actual result from Litmus Chaos experiment we can describe the stored result report, which contains the run history and experiment status either `Pass` or `Fail`.

```
kubectl get chaosresult -n elmo
kubectl describe chaosresult elmo-bonus-pod-network-latency -n elmo
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully running through this gives you some insights why `experiments` are helpfull to spot `weaknesses` in your system, even it's not Production.
